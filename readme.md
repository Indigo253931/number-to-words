# Numbers to Words

> ***Note:*** *This is a pair programming activity.*

## Exercise

#### Introduction
- Start by pseudo-coding with your partner. Focus on the low numbers first.

#### Challenge

- In this lab we will be creating an algorithm to_words that can turn Arabic numbers into english words:
  ```
  to_words(1)   # => "one"
  to_words(32)  # => "thirty two"
  to_words(185) # => "one hundred eighty five"
  ```

  - Start by pseudo-coding and start by thinking only about the numbers under 10. Then work on numbers up to 100.

**Bonus:**
- Can your algorithm work for numbers 100-999?
- Can it work up to 1000? 1000000?
- Can you make your algorithm recursive?

### Self Evaluation

During the previous exercise, rate your progress on a scale of 1-5 (5 being the highest) for the following criteria:

- **Persistence:** Do you handle frustration well? Do you independently pursue understanding?
- **Organization:** Do you thoughtfully implement best coding patterns and practices?
- **Collaboration:** Do you make an effort solve problems and share your ideas with others?
- **Communication:** Do you clearly convey your thoughts to others in illustrative and clear ways?
- **Self-compassion:** Do you make productive use of turning failures into learning opportunities?
- **Resourcefulness:** Do make an effort to compare and contrast new ideas with ones you already know?
