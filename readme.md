# Numbers to Words

> ***Note:*** *This is a pair programming activity.*

## Exercise

#### Introduction
- Your Product Manager wants to add a bit of customization to your 
order response email. She wants to add the order quantity in words to 
you the email so it looks more customized. 

Requirments:
Given an integer from 1-100 return a string with value of the number in
words.

- Start by pseudo-coding and start by thinking only about the numbers under 10. Then work on numbers up to 100.

**Bonus:**
- Can your algorithm work for numbers 100-999?
- Can it work up to 1000? 1000000?
- Can you make your algorithm recursive?
